      <h2>WANT TO BE A MINISTER?</h2>
      <p>
        Would you like to be a Minister of Satan, ordained by The Satanic
        Temple? If you are a member of The Satanic Temple and an active
        participant in our community then you may be eligible to register for
        our online ordination program. At this time, registration for that
        program is by invitation only. You can find more information about who
        is eligible, and what the requirements and responsibilities are for
        our ordained members, on our Satanic Ministry website. If you are not
        eligible to be ordained by The Satanic Temple at this time, you can
        still register for the coursework to take the lessons and earn a
        Certificate of Satanic Scholarship.
