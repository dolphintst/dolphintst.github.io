    <Para>
      Thank you for your interest in the New York City congregation of The
      Satanic Temple. We are a religious Satanic organization. Before contacting
      us about membership, please familiarize yourself with the material on the
      national TST website, particularly the{" "}
      <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us">tenets</a>, the

      on existing TST{" "}
      <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/campaigns">campaigns</a>. In
      addition to upholding the tenets and mission of the national organization,
      TST NYC as a local congregation is committed to maintaining an environment
      of respect and support both at in-person events and online. Misogyny,
      transphobia, racism, anti-semitism, ableism, or bigotry of any kind have
      no place in TST NYC. We expect members to treat each other with courtesy
      at all times.
    </Para>

    <h2>Time commitments</h2>
    <Para>
      Being an active member of our congregation requires a modest time
      commitment. We have an in-person meeting approximately once a month, which
      members should make it a priority to attend. In addition, we may ask
      members to commit a couple hours a week to various ongoing projects as
      needed. If you aren’t able to contribute to TST NYC due to distance or
      schedule, you might want to consider whether another congregation might be
      a better fit for you.
    </Para>
    <hr />
    <h2>We are a religion</h2>
    <Para>
      TST NYC is a congregation of non-theistic religious Satanists. Our tenets
      are some of our deeply held religious beliefs. We use rituals and
      ceremonies that are meaningful to our congregants. We celebrate specific
      holidays, and we are building religious traditions. We are a young
      religion, but we take our beliefs seriously.{" "}
    </Para>
    <hr />
    <h2>We are activists</h2>
    <Para>
      TST NYC is a Satanic community, in addition to being a religion we are
      activists. Cultivating and developing our culture and community of the
      like-minded is important to us. However, our social activism and direct
      engagement in the public sphere is fundamental to our religious mission.

    <h2>New to Satanism and/or the Left Hand Path?</h2>
    <Para>
      You should at least have a basic understanding of what Satanism and The
      Satanic Temple are. We don’t expect you to be an expert, but we do prefer
      you to be self-motivated when it comes to learning. If you are not sure
      where to start, check out the following reading lists: TST NYC & TST
      National.
    </Para>
    <hr />
    <h2>I am not a Satanist, but I support what you do. Can I still join?</h2>
    <Para>
      Maybe. We will be curious to understand why you want to join a religion
      that you don’t intend to adopt. However, we do maintain contact with
      friends and allies that are not members of our congregation, but are part
      of our larger community.
